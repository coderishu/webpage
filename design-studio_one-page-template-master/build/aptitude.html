There's good news and bad news. <span>The good news is that there's not really any need to pay for basic text analysis tools any more,<span>as you can get state-of-the-art open source software to do all the stuff that the expensive commercial solutions do.The bad news is that coaxing state-of-the-art performance (accuracy, speed) from these tools is still a fine art,<b> and likely to remain so. This combination of factors means that the most optimal configuration of a text processing solution is some combination of open source tooling plus either in-house or 3rd-party text processing specialists. <b>How do you find and/or train up these specialists?</b> In the past this has been a hit-or-miss affair, which is where the GATE training and certification programme comes in.
